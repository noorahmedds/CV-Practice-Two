# Lets calculate the optical flow here
# So lets try to implement simple optical flow using Horn and Schunk just because it requires me to know some linear algebra 
# syntax so im gonna prepare myself here with that

# So our optical flow equations are (after intense derivation and solving)
# u = uav - fx(P/D)
# v = vav - fy(P/D)
# P = fx*uav + fy*uav + ft
# D = lambda + (fx)^2 + (fy)^2

# uav is basically the avergae of the immediate neightbours of the current u and v
# vav is same
# fx = roberts_x(first im) + roberts_x(second im)
# fy is same
# ft = [-1, -1; -1, -1]*(first_im) + [1, 1; 1, 1]*(second im)

def main():
    # lets first intialize our global varibales
